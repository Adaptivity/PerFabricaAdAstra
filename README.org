* Introduction
  /Per Fabrica Ad Astra/ (through crafting, to the stars) is an
  extension (mod) of the game Minecraft. Broadly, it aims to enrich
  the science and engineering content of the game. The overarching
  goal is to instill love and knowledge of both disciplines in the
  heart and mind of the player. Since reality is often stranger and
  more interesting than fiction, many of the ideas are directly
  inspired by nature and actual science. Of course, gameplay takes
  precedence over realism, because if no one plays, no one learns.

  /Per Fabrica Ad Astra/ plans to be a collection of independent yet
  tightly integrated modules, each corresponding to a Forge
  mod. Players and server administrators may choose which to enable
  through configuration. Currently, there is only one working mod:
  /Geologica/. It adds realistic and interesting geology to Minecraft,
  with the goal of enhancing the mining experience. /Geologica/
  defines new types of rocks and minerals and relies on the Custom Ore
  Generator mod (which we also maintain) to place them in the
  world. Vanilla stone is completely replaced by the new types of
  rocks.  Mineral deposits, including metal ores and industrial
  minerals spawn in psuedo-realistic veins and clouds, accoding to the
  type of rock.

  Unfortunately, it is not yet possible to very much with the
  minerals. That is the point of chemistry and thus the /Chemica/ mod
  that is only just beginning to take shape. However, we use the
  Forge ore dictionary so that some common minerals can be processed
  via other mods.

* Features
** /Geologica/
 - Adds 23 types of rock to the game.
 - Adds 29 types of metal ores in stone form.
 - Adds 18 types of industrial minerals in stone form.
 - Adds 6 types of sand ores.
 - Adds 8 types of clay ores.
 - Adds furnace recipes for converting the cobble back to stone.
 - Adds cobble, brick, cobble/brick slabs, and cobble walls for each
   type of rock.
 - Adds cobble/brick stairs for limestone, granite and marble.
 - Registers the rock and stone to the Forge ore dictionary under
   conventional names, like "cobblestone" and "stone".
 - Converts all recipes involving rock and stone to use the new ore
   dictionary keys.
 - Provides a configuration file for the Custom Ore Generation mod
   (installed separately) that replaces vanilla stone with the new
   rocks and ores, according to realistic (Earth-like) geology.

*** Rocks
    The rock types are listed in the table below. There are four
    different strength levels: weak, medium, strong and very
    strong. Each strength level corresponds to a pickaxe harvest
    level, such that a wooden pickaxe is only capable of harvesting
    weak and medium stone, a stone pickaxe is required for harvesting
    strong stone, and iron is necessary for very strong stone.

    Shattering a weak stone yields rubble, which behaves much like
    gravel (except does not yield flint). This often makes it more
    difficult to obtain stone tools early in the game, so wooden tools
    receive more emphasis. This models the fact that many types of
    stone, usually sedimentary, are not well suited for
    building. Medium and strong stone will yield particular types of
    cobblestone upon harvesting. These can be smelted back to solid
    stone. Very strong stone is harvested as intact stone.

    Through the provided configuration for the Custom Ore Generator,
    each rock layer is placed according to Earth-like patterns,
    described in the third column. There are three main geological
    regions, defined by the biomes: oceanic (ocean and island),
    volcanic (extreme hills) and continental (every other biome).

    The Occurs column is largely out dated. Someone needs to go read
    the 2300 line COG config file to figure out what really
    happens. Same goes for the other types of ores.
