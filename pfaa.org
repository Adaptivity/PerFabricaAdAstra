#+TITLE: Per Fabrica ad Astra: Through craft, to the stars
* Goal
  Add more realistic and educational aspects to the Minecraft
  experience. We want to teach science (geology, physics, chemistry,
  biology, ...), math, statistics and engineering (algorithms).

* Premise
** Extraction and Chemistry
   The basic idea is to add many realistic raw materials to the world
   and then allow the player to mine them and perform chemistry with
   them to make useful things, including with machines and items from
   other mods.
   
** Star travel
   A relatively advanced player will be capable of building a
   spaceship, in order to seek out resources on other planets. All
   items must be discarded prior to launch, due to weight
   limitations. The player first must colonize the moon. Colonization
   would initially involve programming of robots to perform most
   tasks. A progressively larger network/system of domes would be
   constructed, with a livable atmosphere. Eventually, an
   interplanetary ship would be constructed in low gravity. Then there
   is a choice to go towards the sun (Venus, then Mercury) or away
   (towards Mars). Once on Mars (or Venus) the player must colonize and
   harvest enough food to make the next jump. From Mars, the player
   travels to Ganymede (or back to Earth). From Ganymede, the player must
   build a smaller ship to visit other moons of Jupiter. Or refuel the
   interplanetary ship and fly to Titan. The player may visit other
   notable moons of Saturn. Eventually, the player has colonized all
   planets and notable moons and obtained a resource unique to each. By
   combining those resources, the player may build an interstellar ship
   and begins traveling to known exoplanets or psuedo-randomly
   generated moons. We might also require the user to construct special
   sensor stations on every planet in order to triangulate the position
   of the exoplanet. As an alternative to travel, the player may decide
   to settle down and terraform.

* Gameplay
** Star travel
*** Goals
    On any planet, the goals are:
    * To survive
    * To build a spaceship and fuel for traveling onward
    * To terraform the world for long term settlement

**** Traveling onward
     This goal solves the end-game problem, where the player has
     solved all challenges. The player is given the opportunity to
     leave the conquered world behind, and to start a-new. However,
     there is some continuity: the player is allowed to stock the ship
     with supplies, and subsamples of that inventory appear as supply
     modules strewn about the new world.

**** Terraforming
     It is not clear how we will model this, or how it would benefit
     the robot player. It would be cool though to have NPC colonies
     appear as the conditions were improved.
     
*** Robotic player
    The idea is to initially model the player as a cyborg. This puts
    less constraints on the player in hostile environments. It also
    opens up interesting possibilities for modular player
    abilities. The robot should be humanoid, for simplicity. We still
    want to model the environment, because one goal is to bring NPCs
    (non-cyborgs) to the world.

**** Component-based abilities
     The player abilities will be based on a component system, which
     replaces the armor system. Instead of having a helmet, breast
     plate, etc, the robotic explorer will have the following component
     slots. There is a basic, built-in component of each type that
     never wears down. The others have a limited life-span.

     It turns out that IC2 already has the battery backpack and solar
     helmet, which behave pretty much as we imagined. The gravitation
     suite addon even extends the batpack to support flight. And
     electric armor is essentially a shield. Really, our only
     contribution will be fuel cells as battery alternatives, plus
     different levels of batteries and solar cells.

     This is also related to the mecha-armor of Factorization.

***** Solar panels
      There will be different levels of solar panels, with increasing
      efficiency and cost. Solar panels yield electrical power, at a
      rate depending on the type of panel and the amount of light. When
      the energy is not being used (i.e., when the player is not moving
      or working), the energy is deposited into the battery.
      
***** Battery
      Better batteries: more storage, slower discharge.
      
***** Fuel cell
      This provides power in addition to the solar panels and is
      necessary for powering heavy duties, like drilling/digging. The
      energy output will depend on the type of fuel. Excess energy is
      deposited into the battery.

      Question: could the fuel cell and battery fill the same slot?
      Batteries should be capable of powering heavy machinery (at
      least the type of machinery a humanoid robot would operate). An
      alternative would be to support only batteries, and fuel cells
      would charge the batteries. It makes sense to generalize: a fuel
      cell and battery are both energy sources; the difference is that
      the battery requires electricity for recharging, whereas a fuel
      cell simply needs to be refilled with fuel.

***** Auxiliary system
      There will be one auxiliary that will consume
      power. Possibilities:
      * Balloon/dirigible
      * Shield (combat, lava diving)
      
**** Respiration
     The cyborg has a built-in air tank that automatically recharges
     when in breathable atmosphere. The tanks will store much more air
     than a single lung's worth, so the constraint is more similar to
     hunger than swimming. The player can carry additional air tanks,
     along with food.
         
**** Environmental Modeling
***** Atmosphere
      Important atmospheric properties are:
       * Temperature (depends on day/night)
       * Pressure
       * Composition

       Possible to do this by having special breathable air blocks that
       change properties when they become adjacent to cold or raw
       atmosphere. This may be too complicated though. Easier to
       use force-fields (via MFFS) and then detect when a player is
       outside of a force-field. Non-cyborgs have a limited amount of
       time before death. This depends on the three properties above,
       but comes out to around 30 seconds maybe for Mars.

       If there are missing life support systems within the
       force-field, the atmosphere will slowly deteriorate (over the
       course of say, one day) and then things start dying. The HUD can
       show the current temperature and composition status (green,
       yellow red; not exact values) for the current dome.
       
***** Radiation
      Planets with thin atmospheres and magnetospheres will not be able
      to block the light from the sun. Depending on the type of star and
      distance, this could mean lethal doses of radiation. Effects of
      this radiation would be long-term, however, so it is tough to
      model. Perhaps it would affect the growth of plants.

**** Life Support
     Machines, mechanical or biological, will be capable of
     conditioning the air. These include:
     * Heater/Cooler (increases/decreases temperature, pressure)
     * Oxygen generation (electrolysis, biomass)

     Both types of oxygen generation require water. The ship will come
     with a finite water source. The occupant will produce water as
     water vapor (exhalation) and as waste (urine, feces). The life
     support system must recover that. Otherwise, it needs to be
     provided externally.

     The obvious advantage of a farm is the consumption of CO2 and the
     production of food, thanks to photosynthesis. The light could come
     from the star, or artificial lighting.

     So, in summary, there are three machines:
     * Heater[Factorization]/cooler
     * Greenhouse: <= free CO2, <= H2O, => O2, => food
     * Water reclaimer [TE Aq Accumulator]: <= free H2O, => captured H2O

     And the "world" inside the habitat converts O2 to CO2 and generates
     free H2O (waste, water vapor).

     Note that we will avoid detailed modeling of this process. if a
     machine breaks, bad things happen. The number of plants needed in
     a greenhouse depends on the population. The better the
     conditions, the more colonists, the more human resources. Note
     that water could be obtained from indigenous sources. This is why
     a heater/cooler is needed: it requires the user to maintain a
     power source.

     Eventually we might add an alternative to the greenhouse:
     * Oxygen generator [IC2 electrolyzer]: <= H2O, => O2
     * CO2 scrubber: <= free CO2, => captured CO2
     
*** Progression
    An important gameplay mechanic is progression through tiers of
    technology/development. Some mods model this using history: how one
    idea led to the next over time. Since we are focused on the
    present, historical progression is not relevant. Instead, we might
    follow the technical complexity gradient: one technology depends on
    having another. The robot is stranded on another world with limited
    supplies, and the lofty goals of either leaving the planet or
    terraforming it.

*** Initiation
    How does one become the robot? This could happen through a long
    string of technological developments, based e.g. on IC2, or we
    could enable early entry.

* Concepts
** Science
*** Physics
    Most of the physics concepts will enter through chemistry. Some of
    the key concepts would be:
    * Mechanics
    * Thermodynamics
    * Light
    * Electricity and magnetism
    Overall, these concepts seem too low-level to easily introduce
    directly.

*** Chemistry
    This seems like the right level, and is most directly applicable
    when it comes to mining and crafting things from mined
    material. This would extend from inorganic to organic chemistry,
    and even on to some simple biochemistry.
    
**** Reactions
     Mined materials will be modeled as chemical compounds, and those
     can then be converted into other compounds using reaction chambers.
     Initially, technology will only allow the simplest of chambers,
     such as cauldrons and stills. Eventually, there are BuildCraft
     machines. Different chambers will carry out different types of
     reactions. Reaction rates will depend on the free energy. This of
     course depends on the temperature and pressure.

**** Knowledge
     How to model chemical knowledge? How does the player "learn" that
     a particuar reaction is possible? The periodic table represents
     the fundamental knowledge of chemistry, and it is also discrete,
     so conveniently breaks down into units of achievement. For every
     mineral or other compound, the player performs a number of simple
     assays and eventually discovers an element. Once all elements in
     a particular compound are known, the chemical formula and other
     information (depending on the general level of
     technology/knowledge) are revealed. This information includes
     some subset of the recipes including that compound, as long as
     the technology exists to achieve the recipe, and all compounds in
     the reaction are known.

     Elements are discovered by solving a puzzle that is roughly
     inspired by how the element was discovered according to
     history. The book of the elements will convey hints.

     The Book of Elements slowly reveals those secrets. It is created
     by sending a book into a 1x1 portabe and having it reappear as the
     Book of Elements. This is to simulate a trip to the future.
     
*** Biology
    High-level biological concepts like plant growth, ecology, etc,
    are already modeled in the game. Perhaps those models could be
    improved. The low-level concepts like molecular biology would be
    too complex to model outside of simple e.g. bacterial
    systems. Genetics is a real possibility. The bees and
    tree-breeding of Forestry are a good example.

** Engineering
   Most of Minecraft could be construed as civil engineering. Some
   disciplines that might need more attention:

*** Mechanical
    Would require much better physical modeling. This would be tough.

*** Aerospace
    Like mechnical, requires more physical modeling.

*** Chemical
    This comes about naturally by constructing the machines necessary
    to carry out chemistry (see that section).

*** Electrical
    Already exists to some extent with red stone cicuits. Good enough.

*** Computer Science
    The key direction would be robotics. ComputerCraft already offers
    that, and we should integrate with it.
    
* Blocks
** Rocks
   Generating terrain with multiple rock types, instead of simply
   stone, would make mining much more interesting. Not only would it
   add variety (and thus more creativity in construction), it would
   also help the player find ores, since ores would be specific to
   certain rock types. This idea is from TFC, but it also reflects
   the reality. COG might allow us to generate the rocks, in addition
   to the ores. It looks like the substitution pattern would work,
   but it would need a height restriction. Also, we would need
   restrictions on relative height (percentage of altitude).

   There are three types of rock: igneous, sedimentary and
   metamorphic. The igneous rocks are either intrusive (magma) and
   extrusive (lava). A second axis is the silicate content, which
   decreases with felsic, intermediate, mafic and
   ultramafic. Sedimentary rocks are either clastic or
   (bio)chemical. The metamorphic rocks can be formed by a number of
   different processes: hydrothermal, contact, barrovian,
   blueschist, and eclogite. The last two are probably too deep for
   us to care about. Unless otherwise indicated, rocks are
   generated as layers. So far, we have 21 rock types. It would be
   good to reduce this to 16, just for simplicity. We will need two
   block IDs anyway, in order to model soft vs. hard rock.

   We could drop pegmatite and serpentinite, because they are already
   so enriched for minerals. Tough call. They do serve a purpose:
   indicating that ores are nearby.

   Placement of the rocks during world generation will be
   complex. Lets focus first on the bottom layer, which will consist
   of rock formed by cooling magma, i.e., igneous intrusive
   rock. These intrusions form dikes as the magma rises, and sills
   where the magma is deposited. The differentiation occurs by two
   major processes: fractional crystallization (multiple layers
   crystallizing from molten rock) and partial melting (where only
   some of the minerals melt, rise due to lower density, and
   recrystallize). This follows the order of ultra-mafic, mafic,
   intermediate, felsic, from bottom to top. We consider only
   partial melting, for simplicity.

   When the magma breaches the surface, we then have extrusive rocks
   with different crystallization (much more rapid cooling) but the
   same chemical compositions. The type of rock that emerges depends
   on how much the rock has cooled, and whether water is present.
   
   Land masses are formed by plate convergence, which occurs at the
   interface of land and ocean. The oceans then are undergoing plate
   divergence. Under the ocean, ultra mafic rocks (peridotite)
   partially melt and rise quickly due to the divergence, and hit the
   ocean as mafic melts, forming basalt. The melts that fail to reach
   the surface form the intrusive mafic gabbro. In the case of plate
   convergence, mountains and volcanoes are formed. Since water from
   the ocean is brought down into the subduction zone, the melting
   points of the rocks are lowered and thus more silicate-rich melts
   (intermediate and felsic) emerge from partial melting. So volcanic
   islands in the ocean are largely basaltic, while the volcanoes
   above subduction zones yield rocks like rhyolite and (from mixing
   of the rhyolitic and mafic magma) andesite. The more water, the
   more silicate content, and the more violent the eruption.

   With that in mind, the oceans are clear: peridotite (too low to
   include), gabbro, basalt and sediments (mudrock).  The vast
   majority of the land mass is formed from silicate-rich magma that
   cools before it reaches the surface. This is largely
   granite. Above subduction zones, granite is pushed up into
   mountains, above some diorite, then gabbro.  In areas outside of
   the mountains and oceans, the world will only reach down into
   diorite. We ignore komatiite, because its intrusions happened long
   ago and has largely metamorphed. We will assume that the extreme
   hills are a volcanic mountain range, and the ice mountains are
   a result of sedimentary and metamorphic rock being uplifted
   (crumpled) by subduction forces.

   The generation of the rock layers depends on the biome. The table
   below attempts to specify the rock combinations for each
   biome. For simplicity, we group all types of mudrock (claystone,
   conglomerate, etc) into a single rock. Metamorphic rocks will be
   listed separately, as their formation will be randomized and
   replace specific rocks.
   
   The layers are numbered from top (1) to bottom. The final layer
   should be about half the size of the others.

   In the table we list sedimentary as a general class including
   mudstone, claystone, siltstone, sandstone and limestone. A layer
   of mudrock will typically consist of a mixture of layers from
   these rocks. Claystone and siltstone are two ends of the mudstone
   spectrum. There is currently no "silt" in the game, and it would
   probably not add much, so we might have siltstone just drop dirt,
   or just get rid of it altogether. Then we have claystone=>clay,
   and conglomerate/breccia=>gravel when harvested. Clay is
   somewhat of a limiting resource in minecraft, so we should limit
   claystone distribution. The beach and desert will be largely
   sandstone. The ocean bottom will be limestone, and limestone could
   also dominate hill biomes. Outside of the hills, lets say 65%
   mudstone, 10% sandstone, 10% conglomerate/breccia, 10% limestone,
   and 5% claystone.

   Breccia should replace much of the gravel at depth.

   What about mudstone? It consists of a mixture of silt and
   clay. It could drop a mixture of clay and sand, or should that
   require further processing? Perhaps claystone, conglomerate,
   mudstone, etc all yield a type of "debris" that could be
   processed? The debris would be similar to gravel, but distinct
   from it. Or it could be a type of gravel, but then what of the
   existing gravel? Either way, the debris would act much like
   gravel/sand. Maybe just coarser than gravel. Then, we have the
   following grinding recipes:
   * Mudstone: sand + clay dust
   * Conglomerate: sand + gravel

   Now for metamorphosis.

   Mudrock will convert to slate, and slate, along with igneous
   rocks, can follow the sequence to schist and gneiss. This is most
   likely to happen in the ice mountain biome, and to a lesser extent
   the hill biomes, since more pressure will be put on the
   rock. Slate replaces the top half of the sedimentary layer, schist
   replaces the top third of the igneous (granite) layer, and gneiss
   replaces the next third down. Rocks can exist without rocks
   earlier in the sequence, but having an earlier rock doubles the
   chance of having a later one.

   With regard to contact metamorphism, hornfel and marble will
   sometimes replace the mudstone between the limestone hills and the
   underlying granite. The sandstone under the desert hills will
   sometimes become quartzite.

   Serpentinite will occur anywhere an ultra-mafic intrusion might
   have occurred. We will say that this is in the bottom (diorite)
   layer, except maybe in the extreme hills and ocean, where
   serpentinite is common throughout the crust. If it contacts soil,
   the soil needs to be converted to lateritic soil, which does not
   support growth. Pegmatites occur in granite and gneiss. Both of
   these will be large, thick veins that contain many ores.

   To fit in celestine, we will need to drop something like
   wolframite.
   
   In terms of gameplay, there is a limit to the number of ores. The
   player might constantly encounter ores and have difficulty sorting
   them. Solutions would include having ores occur rarely, or
   deriving metals as the by-product of processing other ores. Both
   support technology tiers, as advanced machines could be required
   to process the more advanced metals. Currently, that is modeled by
   the type of pickaxe. The first has the advantage of making
   discovery more challenging, while the processing approach could
   encourage automation, because large amounts of ore will need to be
   processed. It also requires the player to make a decision about
   how an ore should be processed. Thus, it adds strategy. Ore
   discovery could also be made more stategic by making deposits
   depend on the rock type or having deposits co-occur (better dig
   into that iron because it might have manganese). Some mixture of
   the two is probably best, and certain metals could be obtained by
   both approaches.
   
   By changing the ore distributions to such an extent, gameplay is
   greatly affected. For example, a quarry is unlikely to be a
   profitable or at least interesting investment, since it might only
   gather one or two types of ore. The fun is in the digging. Thus,
   perhaps all generation should occur in a Mystcraft age. There could
   be a symbol for each type of ore, and one for adding the new
   rocks. Modifiers would also be supported, but they would add
   instability. Obtaining each symbol would involve some
   challenge. Many could be found in mineshaft chests, temples or
   villages (possibly specific villages from Millenaire?). Need to
   wait for COG to support the new Mystcraft API.
   
   TE has the induction smelter which allows for complex smelting
   (two inputs, and a primary/secondary output). The Factorization
   mod has a complex and interesting smelting process, which involves
   the Slag Furnace, with two outputs. The main problem is that there
   is no way to convert energy between FZ and BC/IC2.
    
   See this as a way to prioritize:
   http://www.theodoregray.com/periodictable/Elements/PopularInCollections/index.html

   Getting balance from production levels is complicated. The ore
   production levels are confounded with the purity of the ore, while
   the metal production may represent only a minor application of the
   ore. We are interested in *potential* metal production and want to
   assume that each ore block contains the same amount of metal,
   across all metal elements. Another assumption: each ore block is
   the same weight; i.e., they have different densities. We then
   normalize everything to iron for convenience.

   This gives a total of 16 weak, 16 medium and 14 strong
   minerals. And one very strong (corundum), but we might model that
   as chance-dropped gems, instead of as a separate
   block. Technically, Beryl is very strong, although we have it set
   as strong for now.

   Graphite deposits:
   * Clouds in schist, quartzite, gneiss; in lower sedimentary range.
   * Much rarer clouds in marble.
   * Metamorphized coal deposits.
   * Veins in schist, quartzite, gneiss, marble.
     
** Sands
   Here are some sand types we could model:
    
   | Type         | Occurrence    | Use                        |
   |--------------+---------------+----------------------------|
   | Mineral sand | beach/river   | placer deposit (see above) |
   | Garnet       | beach         | abrasive                   |
   | Volcanic ash | extreme hills | abrasive                   |
   | Quartz       | desert        | abrasive, quartz           |
   | -Cassiterite | beach/river   | tin                        |


   Currently, we have different types of mineral sands. These need to
   be separated into minerals like rutile, zircon, magnetite,
   etc. This is usually done with electrostatic separation. About 70%
   of the sand is "trash", consisting of quartz (30%), magnetite
   (25%), garnet (20%), chromite (15%) and kyanite (10%). The more
   valuable minerals in the remaining 30% are: ilmenite (50%), zircon
   (30%), rutile (15%), monazite (5%). Total mineral sand production
   is 4.8 million tonnes / yr, or about 6:1 with Fe. Basaltic sands
   will have more ilmenite, while granitic will have less. There is a
   chance drop of diamond from basaltic sands.

** Hot springs
   Some percentage of the water source blocks near bedrock will be
   converted to hot springs, which are infinite steam
   sources. Buildcraft (or some other mod) has apparently already
   added springs (infinitely pumpable water sources); just need hot ones.

** Brines
   Brines are a source of many minerals. We could add these as
   liquid source blocks in sets that form little lakes/wells. The
   wasteland water could be considered brine.

   Types:
   * Owens Lake :: Borax, NaCl, Na2SO4
   * Midland :: Br, CaCl2, I, MgCl2, KCl, NaCl
   * Searles Lake :: Borax, LiCl, Li2CO3, Mg(OH)2, KCl, NaBr,
                     Na2CO3, NaCl, NaF, Na2PO4, Na2SO4
   * Silver Peak :: Li2CO3, KCl
   
   Do we really want these four, somewhat arbitrary, types? Probably
   not. Just take the union. Chemical processing will separate.

   List of chemicals/minerals:
   * Borax
   * *NaCl* (halite)
   * NaBr
   * NaF
   * Na2CO3 (soda ash)
   * Na2SO4 (salt cake, mirabilite when hydrous)
   * Na3PO4
   * *LiCl*
   * Li2CO3 (also from spodumene)
   * *KCl* (sylvite)
   * *MgCl2*
   * Mg(OH)2
   * CaCl2
   * *Bromine*
   * *Iodine*
     
   Only the ones in *bold* are commericially extracted.
   
** Sea water
   There are many minerals in sea water. But how to model those? We
   cannot replace the blocks, because that would break other mods. One
   could attempt to trace pipes back to the sea, but it would be
   brittle. Imagine an aqueous accumulator that is accumulating sea
   water; no other machines, like the liquid transposer, know that it
   is brine. There is a liquids API in forge now, so in theory things
   could be abstracted, but there is no way to create a new "subclass"
   of water. It is either water or brine. So maybe we just need to
   create brine wells/springs. Otherwise, the processing would need to
   be very slow, because water is so plentiful. Ensure that source
   blocks are not transportable by bucket. Or just use the water
   sources in the ExtraBiomes wasteland. Here is an idea: require that
   the initial processing (could be some filter or something) must
   occur in the ocean biome. This more or less achieves the desired
   effect.

** Concrete
   Minecraft needs concrete. One of the cool things about concrete
   is that one can pour it into molds and generate many objects of the
   same shape. The player could construct a shape out of microblocks,
   hook it up to a pipe (via some adjacent machine) and pump concrete
   into it. The machine will then, after some time, yield an item of
   the desired shape, consuming some amount of concrete. 
   
* Items
** Chemicals
*** General
    We could model chemicals at a number of different levels of
    detail. For example, we could record every property, or simply
    consider the name. Optimal is somewhere in between.

    Some obvious properties:
    * Formula (name would be in translations)
    * Color (black, blue, green, ...)
    * Phase at room temperature (and standard pressure)
    * Hazards: health (0-4), flammability (0-4), reactivity (0-4),
      special (reacts with water, asphyxiant, oxidizer)
    
    One could imagine adding more properties that might lead to
    automatic recipe generation, but this is not worth it.

*** Alloys
    Metals can be combined in a huge number of ways. Here are the
    available alloys:
    
    | Alloy            | Metals       | Production | Use       |
    |------------------+--------------+------------+-----------|
    | Stainless steel  | 6Fe+2FeCr+Mn | blast      | many      |
    | Galvanized steel | Fe+Zn        |            |           |
    |                  | Mg+Al        |            |           |
    |                  | Ca+Pb        |            | batteries |
    |                  | Sb+Pb        |            | batteries |
    | Brass            | Cu+Zn        |            |           |
    |                  | Te+Fe/Cu/Pb  |            |           |

    Properties of steel alloys:
    * Machinability: MnS, Bi, Pb, Se, Te
    * Corrosion resistance: Cr, Cu, Ni
    * Toughness: B, Cr, Mn, Mo, Ni, Cu, Si, V, W, Ti, Nb
    * Temperature tolerance: W, V
    
    Other alloyants: Al, Co, Ce, Sn, Zn, Zr
    
    We could model steel alloys by allowing up to 3 non-iron ingots
    to be included in the smelting. Those non-iron ingots could be
    all of the same material, or different materials.
    In addition, there could be "super alloys".

    How to model the different properties? One easy way is higher
    yield recipes. But what about differentiating the properties?

    Types of steel alloys:
    
    | Alloyants   | Properties                              | Use                                    |

*** Hazards
    There are many fun possibilities when it comes to hazards. These
    rely on some model for chemical spills. Does this happen when a
    pipe or machine breaks (presumably due to some initial hazard?).
    
**** Health
     Damages player without other environmental effects.
     * Level >1, starts to hurt if ingested (increasing damage with level).
     * Level >2, hurts if held in inventory (open container) or touched
     * Level 3: damage similar to cave spider poison
     * Level 4: like burning in lava (must drink milk to stop)
     
**** Flammability
     Will ignite when in contact with a flame, depending on
     temperature. Temperatures for each level:
     * Level 1: > 200 C
     * Level 2: > 100 C
     * Level 3: > 23 C, flammable outside of ice biomes
     * Level 4: < 23 C, always flammable
     
     At ordinary temperature, the difference between L3 and L4 is a
     matter of degree. If player catches on fire with flammable items
     in inventory, the items will burn up, damaging the player. For
     L3 and L4, using flint and steel will ignite items in inventory.
     
**** Reactivity
     Will explode, depending on temperature/force:
     * Level 1: explodes if heated > 200 C
     * Level 2: explodes if heated > 100 C
     * Level 3: explodes if near any heating or another explosion 
     * Level 4: explodes whenever thrown (or anything from L3)
       
**** Special
     * Water reactive: obviously blows up when contacts water!
     * Asphyxiant: when exposed, count down as if underwater, then pain
     * Oxidizer: fuels existing fires

    Some chemicals are obtained from other mods:

** Tools
** Batteries
   In increasing order of cost and energy density:
   * Lead acid
   * NiMH
   * Lithium iron phosphate
     
** Plastics
   Plastics could serve as alternative to metal in many items. Would
   be produced from petroleum processing.
   
* Chemical Processing
** Unit Operations
   These are the physical units of chemical engineering. Basically
   these are types of mixing, separation and reacting.

*** Fluid Flow
**** Transport
***** Fittings and valves
      Fittings connect pipes, as well as measure and regulate flow
      through pipes. Buildcraft should provide enough here.
      The table below outlines this. We have excluded trivial
      connections between pipes. 

      | Type         | BC                   | Notes                    |
      |--------------+----------------------+--------------------------|

      | On/Off valve | Iron/Wooden pipe     | redstone signal          |
      | Check        | Iron pipe            |                          |
      | Regulating   | Gates                |                          |
      
***** Pipes
      BC has us covered here. One issue is temperature. Might
      temperature (difference from ambient) degrade over time, much
      like electricity? Then there are different types of insulation.
      
***** Pumps
      BC has a pump.
      
***** Compressers
      We can use BC pipes to move gases as a fluid, but we need the
      equivalent of a pump, except for gas. It would collect gas from
      the atmosphere. If nearby a machine that emits gas freely (like
      a furnace) it will collect the gas and output to a pipe.
      
**** Filtration
     The idea here is to separate solid phase from liquid phase. Other
     ways to achieve this: decantation, cyclonic separation and
     centrifugation. The behavior depends on the filter media. BTW has
     a filter that is based on the same concept but will simply
     exclude items from its inventory. The ideal filter would have a
     slot for the media and then two outputs: one liquid, one solid.
     
**** Fluidization
     The inverse of filtration: turning a solid into a liquid by
     infusing it with water or gas. Just a type of mixing.

*** Heat transfer
    Heat (energy) transfer from one substance to
    another. Applications:
    * Heat exchanger: efficient transfer between fluids
    * Thermal energy storage: e.g. insulated water tanks (could store
      Railcraft steam in a tank)
    * Electricity generation: thermopile (RP2)

    Most interesting for processing (i.e., distillation) is the heat
    exchanger, which could either a condenser (cooling) or
    evaporator/boiler (heating). Railcraft already has a great boiler
    system that we could leverage. Need a condenser.

*** Mass transfer (separation)
    Moving chemicals from one solution/phase to another. Forms the
    basis of fluid filtration. See section on separation.

*** Mechanical
    Mostly working with solids.
    
**** Solid transportation
     Trust BC/AE here.
    
**** Crushing, pulverizing
     Many machines already perform this for ore processing. Examples:
     * IC2 macerator (1 output)
     * TE pulverizer (2 outputs)
     * GT industrial grinder (4 outputs)
     
**** Screening/sieving
     Presumably this is how the pulverizer and grinder separate
     materials. 
     
** Unit Processes
   These are types of chemical (rather than physical)
   processes. These are somewhat orthogonal to machines. But we list
   them to make sure we support these types of chemistry:
   * redox: ore reduction in furnace, electrolysis
   * (de)hydrogenation
   * hydrolysis
   * (de)hydration
   * (de)halogenation
   * (de)nitrification
   * (de)sulfonation
   * (de)alkylation
   * esterification
   * polymerization
   * polycondensation
   * catalysis

** Separation
   There are different methods of separating/purifying compounds:
   * Filtration: depending on filter media
   * Decantation/Settling: tanks that over time would separate solid
     and liquid
   * Distillation: leverage heat transfer processes to partially
     evaporate, then condense. The Forestry still and the brewing
     stand are close, but neither of them would work. Probably best
     to model this as a combination of heat transfer components.
   * Precipitation: would happen in chemical reactor, but then the
     solid phase needs to be separated.
   * Crystallization: uses a special solvent to cause one fraction to
     crystallize; as in Factorization's crystallizer. 
   * Centrifugation: based on differences in density, basically an
     accelerated version of settling.  The GT industrial centrifuge is
     the only real existing option.
   * Sieves: difference in particle size. We can imagine that the TE
     pulverizer and GT grinder work this way.
   * Extraction:
     * Leaching: Dissolve some fraction of a solid; simple if water,
       could use the Forestry carpenter, and then boil.
     * Liquid-liquid: Relies on solubility differences b/w solvents;
       this would typically involve mixing another solvent into a
       mixture and then letting it settle. Representing multi-solvent
       mixtures may be complicated. Another issue is that the two
       solvents will likely be water and a non-polar organic solvent;
       organic chemistry is complicated.
   * Adsorption: sticking to a surface, as in cyclonic separation;
     may be too similar to filtration
   * Magnetic: could work for magnetite, otherwise...
    
   The easiest to get working would be centrifugation, sieves and
   maybe fractional melting. Leaching would be a special case for
   making e.g. potash. Could also create a still if we need one.

   How to model this? We could track actual phase transition
   temperatures, densities, particle size, etc. But that would be
   crazy. A more abstract model: a list of chemicals that compose a
   particular ore/mixture, possibly with percentages. The number of
   separated chemicals will depend on the number of outputs for a
   machine. Are the outputs always pure (simplest) or could they also
   be mixtures themselves? This would present opportunities for chain
   processing. Are some only separatable by certain techniques?

*** Distillation
    Components of a distillery:
    * Heater/boiler (e.g., steam powered)
    * Distillation column, consisting of multiple blocks
    
    At each level of the distillation tower, gas may be extracted and
    condensed. The higher the tower, the finer the separation. The
    boiler sits next to the base of the tower. The "bottoms" liquid
    can be extracted from the bottom of the tower. Optionally, a
    vacuum can be attached to the top, for when the temperature has
    an upper limit (petroleum refining). In theory, the heat gained
    by the condensers could be transferred to the boiler, i.e, they
    would take in water and emit steam, which would flow to the
    boiler, although the boiler would need additional steam.
    
*** Gravity-based separation
    This relies on materials having different specific gravities.

    Types:
    * Centrifuge :: Spins an object so that its contents separate by
                    density through centrifugal force. This requires
                    a lot of energy. This already exists in GT.
    * Spiral :: Spiral sluice relies on gravity to accelerate
                materials down the incline, with the denser materials
                tending toward the middle. No energy required.
    * Settling :: A multiblock settling tank could take a mixture at
                  the top and yield one or more solids (one from each
                  of the bottom blocks) depending on the relative 
                  densities. The more blocks, the more liquid that
                  can be processed. This is simpler and cheaper than
                  spiral separation, but proceeds much more slowly.
    * Cyclonic :: A cyclone of fluid (liquid or gas) is established,
                  denser particles hit the wall and fall
                  out. Liquid/solid separators are called
                  hydroclones. These require liquid under pressure and
                  thus some energy.
    * Shaking Tables :: Shake it, denser particles fall to bottom. No
                        need for liquid here. Requires some energy,
                        pretty slow.
    * Jig Beds :: Fluidized bed with pulsing water instead of
                  shaking. Works faster than shaking tables but
                  material will need to be dried.
    
    Centrifuge recipes:
     | Input       | Output                   |
     |-------------+--------------------------|
     | Monazite Cl | CeCl:50 LaCl:25 NdCl: 15 |
     |             |                          |

*** Leaching
    Some substances are obtained through water leaching and then
    boiling off the water. The leaching machine will take one solid
    and one liquid input, and yield a liquid, fairly slowly.

   | Input    | Output            |
   |----------+-------------------|
   | charcoal | pearl ash (K2CO3) |
   |          |                   |
    
*** Froth Flotation
    Desired ore is derivatized (via a collector) to become more
    hydrophobic. It is mixed into a water bath, and air bubbles rise
    through the bath, capturing the hydrophobic ore
    constituents. This is mostly used for sulfide ores.

    The machine would accept air (from a compressor) and the ore
    slurry (from mixer with collector).

    Important collectors:
    * (K/S)EX (K/Na ethyl xanthate): Cu, Ni, Ag, Au extraction
    
    Using froth flotation should double ore output. Should be
    possible to recover the collector.
    
*** Drying
    This means removing water from an aqueous solution to yield a
    purer liquid from the solute. The fluid is passed over/through
    some matrix that reacts with the water, removing it from solution.

*** Electrostatic
    Charge-based separation. Useful for small particles like mineral
    sands. Requires some energy to maintain the electric field. No
    slurry required.

*** Magnetic
    Uses a magnetic field instead of an electric field. Requires some
    energy for the electromagnet.
    
** Reactions
   A chemical reactor performs some combination of these functions:
   * mixing
   * separating
   * heating
   * cooling
   * pressurizing

   A key question is whether these tasks are performed by separate
   machines or one monolithic reactor. The most fun would be separate
   machines.

   See next sections for further discussion.

** Mixing
   Need a machine to mix solids, liquids and gases. Technically, this
   is a challenge, because it would require modeling mixtures of
   fluids. In theory, we could have a mixture liquid using
   damage. This would support up to ~16000 chemicals in binary
   mixtures. For arbitrary mixtures during processing, binary is
   probably sufficient. Ores will be more complex, but those can be
   modeled individually.

   Types of mixers we would want:
   * combining two fluids or gases
   * dissolving a solid or absorbing a gas into a solution
   * combining a solid and fluid to a slurry
   * mixing two solid dusts

   All of these take two inputs and emit one output, or two outputs
   when there is a solid/liquid plus a gas. The difference really are
   three types of input: two fluids, two solids or a fluid and a
   solid.  These correspond to liquid agitators, dust blenders and
   fluidizing beds, respectively.
   
** Temperature
   Fluids will need to be heated and cooled. If a reaction occurring
   in a mixture releases or requires heat, then cooling or heating
   must be applied to the reaction chamber. One type of heater would
   be a simple electric heater, but heat transfer devices would be
   more efficient. Steam/water could be piped into the heat
   transfer device, and they would emerge in a cooled or heated form
   (steam would become water, water steam). Heat exchangers are
   typically made from stainless steel, as well as Cu/Ni and Ti.

   Does the reaction mixing chamber itself require temperature
   control? In real life, this is the case, but how to model it? The
   device already has 3/4 material connections, plus power. This would
   be two more connections. May be workable. The simple electric
   heating chamber is also an option. Or a separate block.

   In fact, heating/cooling of fluids outside of the chamber may
   present technical complications: each "temperature" of each liquid
   would need to be registered. Or maybe we could analyze the network
   to determine what the temperature should be? That *might* work
   since the temperature is not an inherent property of the substance
   (like its composition). To store a chemical at a temperature, a
   heated/insulated tank is necessary. Wait for use cases.

** Pressure
   If the player can control temperature, then the pressure could be
   controlled independently through the amount of reactants and the
   volume of the chamber. If we assume that the volume is fixed
   (reasonable) then it comes down to the amount. The reactants need
   some sort of buffering both for convenience and to attain the
   correct stoichiometry. Perhaps we could have the amount depend on
   the input pipe. Ultimately, this may be too complicated;
   temperature should be enough to make the game interesting.
   
** Electrolysis
   Electrolysis will reduce just about anything. If we know the
   chemical formula of the substance, we can easily calculate the
   product of redox reactions. IC2 has an electrolyzer for making
   energy cells, or something. GT has a much more interesting
   one. But we probably need a smelting electrolyzer to deal with
   e.g. bauxite processing.

   A more complicated form is electrorefining. This requires
   dissolving the metal in H2SO4 and performing electrolysis. The
   anodes would be need to be transferred to a grinder for recovery of
   the metals. This means that electrodes need to be continually
   manufactured and replaced; perhaps every 10 buckets of
   electrolyte. Partial yields from grinding partially mature
   electrodes should be allowed. A number of minor outputs are
   possible from grinding the dust.

** Smelting
   Types of smelting:
   * Roasting/calcining: conversion of sulfide and carbonate ores to
     oxides. This occurs at low temperature; any furnace is capable.
   * Reduction: conversion of oxide to elemental metal. Requires
     reducing agent like coal or sand.
     
   Furnaces and smelting is central to Minecraft, so we do not want
   to change that dramatically; however, we could add more
   sophisticated smelting options, with higher yield.

   Possible reduction progression (ingot:ore/dust):
   * Vanilla furnace and other simple furnaces (1:1) 
   * Induction smelter (2:1 + slag), requires coal/sand
   * Industrial blast furnace *Fe only* (3:1 + 2 slag), requires coke,
     limestone flux and air input; oil, tar, natural gas can be added
     to the coke for additional energy and speed (4:1). GT has since
     added something with this name. Maybe blast smelter?
   
   Possible roasting progression:
   * Vanilla furnace and other simple furnaces (1:1)
   * Fluidized bed roaster: twice as fast (2:1), requires air to be
     pumped into the chamber
   
** Ore processing
   More complex chemistry happens when extracting metals from
   ore. Preprocessing of mineral ores involves these unit operations:
   * Comminution :: Simply grinding/pulverizing
   * Sizing :: Selecting the particles by size; could be simple
               screens or could rely on different settling velocities
               (things like cyclones and trommels). We can probably
               ignore this step.
   * Concentration :: Concentrating the ore is more complicated, and
                      there are many methods (see separation section):
     * Gravity/density-based
     * Chemical, e.g. froth-flotation
     * Electrostatic
     * Magnetic
   * Dewatering :: If a slurry is formed during separation, the water
                   needs to be removed. Perhaps by filtering,
                   sedimentation, or drying (requires more energy).
   
   The rest of this section describes how each specific ore can be
   processed into economic materials.
   
*** Magnetite
**** Vanadium
     Although vanadium is present in several ore minerals, it is
     typically isolated from magnetite and ilmenite ore, and some times
     carnotite (uranium) ore. It can also be extracted from flue dust
     of heavy oil, phosphate ore slag and bauxite. Here we focus only
     on extraction from magnetite.
     
     Vanadium is typically isolated from slag formed during conversion
     of the pig iron to steel. The Railcraft blast furnace does not
     output any slag. Rather than reimplementing the blast furnace, we
     could use the slag produced during magnetite ore smelting in the
     induction smelter (magnetite ore/2*dust + sand => 2*iron +
     magnetite slag). That slag is then resmelted with sodium
     carbonate/chloride/sulfate, or lime to produce dirty NaVO3
     dust. This is leached with water and ammonium vanadates are
     precipitated with ammonia. The ammonia is decanted and the
     precipitate is roasted to V2O5. To get elemental vanadium, we need
     to smelt V2O5 with CaCl2 or aluminum dust. Thus, the overall
     process is smelt, leach/precipitate/decant, roast and smelt. The
     roasting and smelting is already possible. Could maybe use the
     carpenter for the leaching, but we need a machine with liquid
     output. A fluid reactor would mix the NaVO3 (aq) and ammonia,
     resulting in an aqueous mixture ammonia and and solid vanadate. A
     liquid/solid separator yields the vanadate powder for roasting.
 
*** Limonite
**** Iron
     Basic smelting.
     
**** Nickel
     High temperature (250 C) leaching of ore with sulfuric acid
     precipitates the iron as hematite. The Ni can then be
     precipitated as a sulfide with H2S gas treatment, and then
     reduced via electrolysis or H2 gas. There is Co mixed with the
     Ni, and it can be extracted by adding Cl2 or ozone to oxidize the
     Co to Co(OH)3, which is insoluble in acid. Say about 20 buckets
     of Ni extract for one Co ingot.
     
*** Chalcopyrite 
**** Copper
     Smelt, optionally with froth flotation to double
     output. Induction smelting with sand/coal will again double
     output and yield chalcopyrite slag. Either of these yields an
     oxide. The oxide can be again smelted, or electrorefined.

**** Cobalt
     The copper oxide is dissolved in sulfuric acid, and the cobalt is
     CoSO4. The copper is electrolyzed, and NaOH is added to the spent
     electrolyte to precipitate Co(OH)2, which is electrolyzed to
     Co. Lets say 20 buckets of spent electrolyte are required for
     one Co ingot.

**** Molybdenum
     After froth flotation, perform another flotation with NaHS
     added, which keeps copper from frothing, thus separating the
     molybdenite, which is processed as normal.
     
**** Minor: Silver, Gold and Platinum
     Electrorefining of copper oxide.

**** Antimony
*** Pentlandite
**** Nickel
     Typical sulfide ore extraction.
 
**** Cobalt
     The same as with chalcopyrite.
     
*** Sphalerite
**** Zinc
     As with all sulfide ores.
     
**** Cadmium
     Crude zinc oxide (after initial roasting) is seeded with zinc dust
     to precipitate CdSO4. Presumably this can be electrolyzed to Cd?
     
*** Galena
**** Lead
     Like any other sulfide ore.
     
**** Silver
     TE pulverizer already yields silver dust from lead ore.
**** Antimony

*** Spodumene
**** Lithium carbonate
     Treat with H2SO4, roast, leach with water and precipitate with Na2CO3.
     
*** Lepidolite
**** Lithium
     See Li ore dust reaction.
     
**** Caesium
     Need to figure this out.
     
*** Dolomite
**** Magnesium
     Ground dolomite is roasted in the presence of ground
     FeSi to produce a mixture of CO2 and Mg gas, as well as CaSiO3
     (wollastonite) mixed with iron dust. Distillation tower separates
     and condenses the Mg. 

     FeSi results from induction smelting sand and iron (maybe an iron
     nugget, because the ingot recipe already exists).
     
**** Calcium
     
*** Rock salt
**** NaCl
     Just grind it up.
     
**** KCl
     Dissolved in brine and heated, so that the KCl and NaCl are
     enriched in a solution. Heat transfer pipe cools the solution,
     and the steam can be used for the heating of the brine. The
     cooling causes the KCl to precipitate. This is separated through
     e.g. centrifugation (settling will not work, because the NaCl
     will precipitate). The left over solution can serve as the brine
     in the initial step.
     
*** Limestone/Marble
**** Calcite (GT)
     Grind to yield CaCO3, plus a 5% chance of CaMg(CO3)2 (dolomite).
     
**** Calcium
     Electrolysis of CaO (roast product of CaCO3) or aluminothermic
     reaction, which involves the reduction of CaO with Al, under
     high temperatures. These temperatures are typically attained by
     surrounding the CaO/Al charge with a mixture of Mg and BaO2.

     Something like:
     3CaO + 2Al => Al2O3 (slag) + 3Ca

     Could allow crafting of an aluminothermic charge (Al+Mg+BaO2).
     It would be placed in a fired clay crucible and ignited with
     flint and steel. There will be flames; nearby things could burn.

     BaO2 comes from oxidizing BaO (roasting or O2 absorbtion), and
     BaO results from heating BaCO3 with carbon. BaCO3 is formed by
     heating (60-70 C) BaS (barite) with NaCO3 (soda ash). Or heated
     CO2 absorbtion. The absorbtion would need to happen in a mixer,
     while the other recipes could be handled by the induction smelter.
     
*** Skarn
**** Calcium
     
*** Uraninite

**** Uranium
     This would be a lot trickier, because it requires liquid/liquid
     extraction using organic solvents (specifically 2.5% amine, 2.5%
     isodecanol and 95% kerosene). We will need such solvents for
     processing any uranium, however. IC2 simply yields pure uranium
     when mined. How boring!
     
     Kerosene comes from oil refining, but the tertiary amine that
     reacts with uranium would be complicated to synthesize. For
     simplicity, let us aim for only ethyl or methyl amines. Those
     can be synthesized from ethanol/methanol and ammonia using a
     zeolite catalyst.

**** Vanadate
     After treating ore with the tertiary amine, mix with the sodium
     carbonate and follow the steps for magnetite.
     
**** Thorium
**** Yttrium
**** Technetium
     
*** Chromite
**** Ferrochromium
     Smelt with coal at high temperature (2800 C); lots of energy. As
     a reference, iron is smelted around 2000 C.

*** Magnesite
**** Magnesium
     Calcined to MgO (magnesia), which is then smelted with Si in
     induction furnace to produce Mg (s) and SiO2 (sand). Could be
     combined into one step.
     
*** Rutile
**** Refining
     Rutile is TiO2. It is refined by mixing in a fluidized bed at
     900C with Cl2 to make TiCl4 (caution: exothermic), fractionally
     distilling it and then oxidizing TiCl4 back to TiO2 in a pure O2
     flame (caution: exothermic, the Cl2 gas can be recovered).
     
**** Titanium
     See the reactions for TiO2.
     
*** Ilmenite
**** Titanium
     Convert to TiO2 (rutile), then follow the listed reactions. TiO2
     is produced by treating ilmenite with sulfuric acid, which
     separates the iron as FeSO4. The FeSO4 is crystallized and
     filtered out. This requires a settling out the liquid FeSO4 and
     then cooling it to a solid. The solid phase in the settling tank
     is washed to obtain TiSO4. That is hydrolyzed (boiled) to hydrous
     TiO2, which needs to be roasted to pure TiO2.
     
*** Garnierite
**** Nickel
     Simply smelt it. In an induction furnace, include a sulfur
     source, like gypsum, for flux.
     
*** TODO Cassiterite
**** Tin

**** Niobium/Tantalum
     
*** Wolframite
    Gravity concentration.
    
**** Tungsten
     WO3 is reduced at 800C with H2 (producing steam). Getting to WO3
     is more complicated. Mix ore with aqueous soda ash, add ammonia
     to form ammonium para tungstate (APT), which precipitates (after
     boiling off the water) and is calcined to WO3.

**** WC (tungsten carbide)
     Induction smelt tungsten ore with coke.
     
*** Scheelite
    Concentrated by froth flotation.

**** Tungsten
     The same as wolframite.
     
*** Cinnabar
    
**** Mercury
     http://mysite.du.edu/~jcalvert/phys/mercury.htm#Prod
     Looks like it is found only in fine-grained massive forms, so
     very little metal will be obtained per ore. The ore is roasted,
     and mercury is distilled from the vapors.
     
*** Bauxite
**** Aluminium
    Dissolved in NaOH at 150-200 C to yield aluminate. The red mud is
    filtered out, and Al(OH)3 is precipitated. That is heated to
    become Al2O3 and melted at 1000 C. Cryolite is added as a flux,
    and then electrolysis yields Al (s). The GT electrolyzer requires
    a lot of energy to process bauxite dust. We could have Al2O3
    increase yield significantly. But that would not incorporate the
    notion of the cryolite.

    Cryolite is Na3AlF6, which can be synthesized as:
    6 NaOH + Al2O3 + 12 HF → 2 Na3AlF6 + 9 H2O

    The HF is made like this (CaF2 is fluorite):
    CaF2 + H2SO4 → 2 HF + CaSO4
    HF is also a by-product of making phosphoric acid from apatite.

    Note that the cryolite is not consumed in the process.

    This will require some special machine, a smelter/electrolyzer,
    that requires less energy than using straight electrolysis.
    
*** Zircon
    Separated from sand using spiral separators. The rutile and
    ilmenite are removed by magnets.
    
**** Zirconium
     Same process as for rutile=>titanium.
     
*** Stibnite
     
**** Antimony
     Much like other sulfide ores. Enriched with froth flotation,
     roasted to oxide, then reduced in an induction smelter with
     coke. Or directly induction smelted with Fe, producing Sb and
     FeS slag.
     
*** TODO Borax
*** TODO Pyrolusite
*** Pollucite
**** Caesium
     Caesium is highly reactive, with both water and air. Seems like
     this is mostly produced during Li production, but here are some
     options:
     
***** Acid digestion
      Add Hcl to eventually yield CsCl (evaporate water). Analogous
      reactions happen with HBr and HF.
      
      Or add sulfuric acid => caesium alum, induction smelt with coke
      and leach with water to yield Cs2SO4 (aq). This could be used
      for caesium formate production.

      CsCl is reduced at 700-800C with Ca or Ba in induction smelter. 
      
***** Alkaline decomposition
      Induction smelt with mixture of CaCO3 and CaCl2, leach with
      water to yield CsCl. 
      
***** Direct reduction
      Induction smelted with Na, K or Ca metal (expensive, maybe
      consumes twice the metal).

***** Electrolysis
      Elecrolyze CsCN. How to get this?

***** Thermal decomposition
      Cook CsN3 at 400C. Seems complicated. Should increase
      yield. Relevant reactions:
      
      2 CsSO4 + Ba(N3)2 → 2 CsN3 + Ba(SO4)2
      2 NaN3 + BaX → 2 NaX + Ba(N3)2
      2 NaNH2 + N2O → NaN3 + NaOH + NH3
      2 Na + 2 NH3 → 2 NaNH2 + H2
    
**** Rubidium
     The caesium alum can be fractionally crystallized to yield tiny
     amounts of rubidium.
      
*** Bastnasite
**** Cerium
     Treated with H2SO4 to make water soluble sulfates. NaOH is added
     and thorium hydroxide precipitates. Ammonium oxalate precipitates
     rare earths as oxalates. They are heated to oxides and dissolved
     in HNO3, leaving behind insoluble cerium salts. Those can be
     induction smelted with Ca or melted and electrolyzed.

     Oxalic acid:
       NH4OH + oxalic acid -> ammonium oxalate
       glucose + HNO3 (or air) --V2O5--> oxalic acid

     Nitric acid:
      * Large scale at 500K, pressurized air for O2: 
        4 NH3 (g) + 7 O2 (g) → 4 NO2 (g) + 6 H2O (g) [platinum/Rh catalyst]
        4 NO2 (g) + 2 H2O (l) → 4 HNO3 (aq)
      * Small scale:
        2 NaNO3 (s) + H2SO4 (aq) → 2 HNO3 (aq) + Na2SO4 (s)
        
*** Tantalite
    Gravity separation.
    
**** Tantulum/Niobium
     Treated with HF to yield complex fluorides. Those are separated
     by liquid extraction, with water/cyclohexanone as the
     solvents. Both niobium and tantalum are extracted. The tantalum
     (or niobium) fluoride is precipitated by addition of KF, and the
     result is reduced with molten Na.

     Cyclohexanone results from oxidizing cyclohexane in air with Co
     catalyst. Cyclohexane results from reducing benzene. This means
     mixing gaseous benzene and H2 with a Pt or Raney Ni catalyst
     under high temperature. Cyclohexane is then condensed.

     Benzene results from oil refining. 
     
*** Molybdenite
**** Molybdenum
     Like any sulfide, it is roasted to an oxide at 700C. It can then
     distilled (sublimated at 1100C) or dissolved in ammonia. To get
     molybdenum metal, reduce with H2 gas.
     
**** Ferromolybdenum for steel
     Aluminothermic reaction w/ the purified oxide and iron.
     
**** Rhenium
     If the gas during roasting is captured, it can be condensed,
     leached with water and treated with NH4Cl to precipitate
     ammonium perrhenate. It can be reduced with hot H2 gas.
     
*** Malachite
**** Copper
     Smelt it.
*** Glauconite
**** Fertilizer
     Smelt, and leach with HCl to make KCl.
     
*** Alunite
**** Alum
     Calcined at low heat, leached with water, evaporated.
     
**** Potassium
     Roasted at 1000C to produce K2SO4 and Al2O2. The K2SO4 is water
     soluble and can be leached off, filtered and the water is
     evaporated.
     
**** Aluminum
     Alumina is the filtrate after roasting and water leaching.
         
*** Flourite
**** HF
     Dissolve in H2SO4.

**** Cryolite
     See Bauxite section.
     
*** Graphite
**** TODO Graphene
     
** Oil refining
   This is the most complex chemical process. Many materials will be
   derived from petroleum.

*** Unit Operations

**** Atmospheric distillation
**** Catalytic reforming
     Reforms the heavy and sometimes light naphta streams into more
     complex, higher octane hydrocarbons. There are four reactions:
     * Dehydrogenation :: changes naphtenes to aromatics like toluene
     * Isomerization :: creates isoparaffins from paraffins
     * Aromatization :: creates aromatics from paraffins
     * Hydrocracking :: breaks paraffins into shorter paraffins

     The liquid naphta is mixed with H2, the mixture is heated to
     vaporize the naphta and they enter the reactor with the
     platinum/rhenium catalyst. The result is cooled to condense the
     hydrocarbons. This process must be preceeded by desulfurization.

     Aromatics can be separated by extraction with diethyl glycol or
     sulfolane. Distillation separates compounds like benzene.

     Diethyl glycol comes from reacting ethylene with air (or O2 is
     faster) w/ Ag catalyst to produce ethylene oxide. Ethylene
     oxide is useful for all sorts of things. It is converted into
     ethyl glycols by mixing with water at 200C. Distillation
     separates mono/di/tri-ethyl glycols.

     Sulfolane results from reacting butadiene with SO2 and reacting
     the resulting sulfolene with H2 (g) w/ Pt or Raney nickel
     catalyst.  Raney nickel is an Ni/Al alloy, activated by Zn or Cr.
     
**** Steam cracking
     This breaks naphtas into smaller hydrocarbons. Naphtas are mixed
     with steam and heated to 850C, then cooled. Light naphta
     generates ethylene (and propylene/butadiene), while heavier
     naphtas generate benzene (and toluene/xylene). Distillation
     separates the components.
     
*** Streams
**** Light naphta
**** Heavy naphta
*** Recovered waste products
**** Vanadate
     Coke from oil refineries contains vanadium. The coke is leached
     using sulfuric acid and then ammonium vanadates are precipated,
     as from magnetite.
     
* Worldgen
** Ore deposits
   By default, all ores will be modeled as veins. PFAA will not
   actually generate any ores. Instead, we will provide a COG config.

   First, internal deposits. Magmatic processes separate ores either
   along a temperature gradient or through solubility
   differences. The latter generates metal sulfides.  Hydrothermal
   action also typically generates sulfides, since sulfur is able to
   carry the metal in the aqueous phase. 

   The surficial deposits generally consist of oxides. These need to
   be processed very similarly to sulfides. Do we distinguish between
   oxides and sulfides? It would present interesting
   chemistry. Sulfides are a source of PGEs, especially with Ni, Cu,
   Cr and Co. Perhaps more importantly, the SO2 produced by smelting
   can be reclaimed as sulfuric acid. The obvious disadvantage would
   be the need for additional block IDs. It also opens the door to
   modeling specific minerals.  The advantage would be that minerals
   could be used for other purposes. Mostly, these relate to coloring
   and other decorative aspects. Nothing wrong with that.

   Some specific types of ore deposits:

   Placer deposits could be modeled by shoveling a black sand, with a
   gold nugget as a rare drop. Pulverizing generates 1 magnetite
   dust, with a 10% chance of gold nugget. Use of a magnet
   (factorization) would also separate magnetite.

   Banded Iron Formations consist of a single, banded
   block. Pulverizing yields 2 hematite dust, with 20% chance of
   magnetite dust. The hematite can be hydrated to red dye, or
   smelted to iron, like magnetite.

   Laterite soils are a type of clay, except cooking is not necessary
   to produce bricks. They can be simply crafted into bricks. It is
   found only within jungles. Within the laterite, there will be
   child veins of bauxite (25%), and iron ore (75%). The lateritic
   iron ore is of two types: yellow and brown (ochres).  When
   pulverized, they yield the corresponding dust, plus a 5% chance of
   nickel ore dust. The dusts can be smelted to iron, or hydrated to
   brown or yellow dye. Smelting is a one-step process for the blast
   furnace, while for other furnaces the ore is first smelted to
   hematite, which is smelted to iron.

   Marine evaporite deposits will consist of limestone, under gypsum,
   under rock salt. Grinding limestone yields calcite + some chance of
   dolomite. Grinding gypsum yields the mineral itself + 20% native
   sulfur. Grinding rock salt yields halite + 50% sylvite. Perhaps
   grinding sylvite could yield MgCl2, say 20% of the time. Borax and
   soda ash occur in lake evaporites (desert-hills only).

   The VMS deposits occur through feslic volcanic activity in
   mid-ocean rifts and continental back-arcs (ice mountains). The
   morphology is globular, with chalcopyrite at the bottom and
   sphalerite/galena towards the top. Gold at the top.

   There is some desire to balance the distribution of ores between
   biomes, so we outline them here by biome:
   
   | Biome         | Rocks                                        |
   |---------------+----------------------------------------------|
   | Continental   | sedimentary, granite, diorite                |
   | Extreme Hills | rhyolite, andesite, granite, diorite, gabbro |
   | Oceanic       | limestone, basalt, gabbro                    |

   | Biome          | Ores                                        |
   |----------------+---------------------------------------------|
   | Continental    | dolomite, coal, BIF, LI, SEDEX              |
   | Extreme Hills  | volcanic ash, 2*LI, carbonatite             |
   | (Frozen) Ocean | 2*dolomite, 2*VMS, LI, 2*SEDEX, 2*BIF       |
   
   These are all considered continental:
   | (Ice) Plains    | evaporite, 2*iron                 |
   | Beach           | basaltic/granitic/garnet sand     |
   | (Frozen) Rivers | granitic sand                     |
   | Desert (Hills)  | quartz sand, evaporite            |
   | Swamp           | 2*coal, laterite                  |
   | Jungle (Hills)  | laterite                          |
   | Ice Mountains   | VMS, 2*iron, granitic/garnet sand |
   | Taiga (Hills)   | 2*iron                            |
   | Forest (Hills)  | conglomerate bowls                |
   
** Extra planets and moons
   Eventually, we want to include all planets (including exoplanets)
   and moons (including psuedo-randomaly generated ones). 

*** Mars
**** Physical properties
     * Mass: 0.107 Me
     * Gravity: 0.376 g
     * Temperature: -143/-63/35
     * Pressure: 6 mb (Humans require: 61.8 mb)
     * Atmosphere: 95% CO2, 3% N2, 2% Ar
     * Crust thickness: 50km (Earth: 40km)
     * Light intensity: 44% of Earth

**** Crust composition
     There is a thin layer of dust (regolith). The red color is caused
     by iron oxide, mostly in the form of magnetite (TFC), and hematite
     (TFC) + goethite (TFC). The magnetite causes the dust to be
     magnetic. The bulk of the dust consists of pulverized plagioclase
     feldspar (say, labradorite), zeolite, and to a lesser extent
     pyroxine and olivine. There is an enrichment for sulfur and
     chlorine. The dust is only millimeters thick, so we might be able
     to model the dust like "snow" and have dust storms.

     Beneath the dust is finely broken up basalt, enriched with sulfur
     and chlorine. These deposits are not concentrated enough to mine,
     but it may be that plants could grow in the soil, with some
     nitrate fertilizer, perhaps, and a greenhouse to control the
     temperature and pressure and filter out the radiation.
     More about soil: http://chapters.marssociety.org/winnipeg/soil.html

     The primary type of rock near the surface is basalt (TFC),
     followed by andesite (TFC), which is more common in the northern
     hemisphere. In the lower layers of the crust, andesite dominates,
     intermixed with other igneous rocks like dacite (TFC) and granite (TFC).

     In fluvial landforms (where water was present), near the surface,
     one can find hematite (TFC), kaolinite (TFC), kieserite, jarosite
     (uninteresting), opal (TFC) and gypsum (TFC). Sandstone is also
     present. Maybe limestone (TFC). Also, the Columbia Hills (in Gusev
     Crater) have minerals formed in the presence of water:
     http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_Hills_%28Mars%29
       
**** Mineable resources
     Ores:
     * Magma action: Ni-Cu-platinoid clusters, Ti, Fe, Cr
     * Hyrdothermal action: Cu, Zn, Pb, Se, Sb, Cd, As, Ag, Au, Te
     * Soil deposits: basaltic soil might contain chromite (CrO2),
       magnetite (Fe3O8), ilmenite (TiFeO3)
     * Fluvial deposits: Mg + SO4 (kieserite), Ca + SO4 (gypsum),
       hematite blueberries
     * Pegmatite deposits near granite: Li
     
     By platinoid, we mean the elements Pt, Pd, Os, Ir, Ru, Rh (very
     rare). These could be produced as a by-product of processing Ni/Cu,
     or even from nuclear reactors. Mostly used for catalysts
     (especially Pd).

     Ores produced by magma action will commonly occur near the surface
     in the volcanic regions. Otherwise, one needs to dig really
     deep. The hydrothermally concentrated ores will be present
     throughout at moderate depths, and at low depths in impact craters
     and volcanic regions. Soil is uniform throughout, except in the
     fluvial deposits, which have their own surface composition and are
     found in the valleys of the southern hills and impact craters.
     
     Water ice will be a minable resource on Mars (and other cold
     planets). This will be found as ice in the polar regions (perhaps
     covered by a layer of dry ice) and also under the surface. The
     northern lowlands and basins will have ice near the surface, while
     one will need to dig deeper in the southern highlands. Volcanic
     regions are unlikely to have any ice, perhaps a little liquid
     water.

     Also important are geothermal energy sources. This "heat"
     could be modeled similar to lava (as a flow) and some machine
     could be attached to such a heatflow to capture it.
     
**** "Geomes"
     The two hemispheres of Mars are quite different:
     * Northern hemisphere (lower, younger, smoother, 32km crust thickness)
     * Southern hemisphere (higher, older, craters, 58km crust thickness)
     The Northern hemisphere accounts for 1/3 of the surface area. 

     Straddling both is the Tharsis volcanic bulge, which are extremely
     tall volcanoes, with sharp ravines running outward. 7-10 km above
     the surroundings. May account for 25% of the total surface area.

     There are several large, ancient impact basins, surrounded by low
     volcanoes. Deepest point at 8km below "sea level". Full of
     sedimentary material. Possibly 10% of surface. 

     There are large ice caps on both poles. 10%?

     Huge canyons (Valles Marineris), 4000km long, 10km deep. There are
     similar, huge outflow channels, with lots of sediment.

     In summary, we might have the following biomes:
     * Plains (25%) [ocean] [plains]
     * Southern hills (25%) [ocean] [desert hills] [+basins] [+canyons]
     * Volcanic bulge (25%) [minor: hills] [extreme hills] [+canyons]
     * Ice caps (10%) [minor: plains, hills] [ice plains]
     * Impact basins (10%) [generated]
     * Canyons (5%) [generated] [ravine] 
  
     To really communicate the scale of these features, compared to
     Earth and all of its weathering and balanced igneous activity, we
     would probably need to increase the height of the world
     4-5X. Without insane hacking of the code, the true upper limit is
     to increase terrain generation up to 256 (2X). We will defer this
     until we get functioning biomes.

**** Portal
     To be most realistic, we would want the player to construct a
     space ship and lauch to Mars. The amount of resources required for
     such a trip would be generally prohibitive. Therefore, we can rely
     on inspiration from rituals related to Mars/Ares. Ideas:
     * Kill a puppy at night (reflects the sacrifice of puppies). Do we
       want this to be on an altar? Like a 1x3 stone surface, with
       torches. Or any stone?

**** Terraforming

*** Venus
*** Mercury
*** Asteroids
**** 4 Vesta??
     Sure, it is tiny, but it is also fairly well characterized.
*** Jupiter's moons
**** Ganymede
**** Io
**** Europa
**** Callisto
*** Saturn's moons
**** Titan
**** Enceladus
*** Uranus's moons
    None worth it
*** Neptune's moons
**** Triton
*** Pluto, other KBOs
*** Exoplanets

** Exoplanet Generation
   The main challenge will be creating semi-realistic exoplanets, with
   interesting, playable and challenging combinations of resources and
   conditions.
   
*** High-level Considerations
    Let us begin with purely physical considerations. A planet will have
    a certain:
    * gravity,
    * temperature (orbital zone, albedo, greenhouse effect of atmosphere),
    * weather, like rain (presence/type of atmosphere)
    * length of day (spin rate; could be tidally locked),
    * atmosphere composition (mass, temperature, crust composition),
    * crust composition (raw material, orbital zone, volcanism, water),
    * potential for alien life (temperature, atmosphere, surface liquids)
    
    Here are some simple relationships:
    * Mass depends on radius and density.
    * Orbital zone depends on the type/size of the star, and the
      distance from the star.
    * Albedo depends on the atmosphere and surface; we might just work
      off of the Kepler assumptions.
    * Volcanism depends on the density of the planet.

    We know these values from Kepler:
    * mass
    * gravity
    * orbital zone
    * temperature (need to somehow adjust for atmosphere)
    The other things are more complicated.

*** Crust composition
    Planets are formed from material left over from star formation, so
    the composition of the raw material will be similar to that of the
    star. Since the material must be solid to accrete into a planet, the
    composition also depends on the the orbital zone. There are three
    basic types of material:
    * Metals (Fe, Ni)
    * Silicates (Si)
    * Ices (C, N, O, S)

    We have measurements for C, O, Si, S, Fe, and Ni. Notably, we are
    missing N, so we will need to assume the solar fraction for
    that. All other minor elements not mentioned here will be assumed
    present at solar fractions.

**** Metals
    The metals will be complexed to form:
    * sulfides like FeS (assume 3/4 of S is consumed), 
    * then oxides like FeO, and finally (probably just ignore)
    * carbides (when C dominates O, i.e., where it is very hot).
    
    This is really just important for calculating the amount of
    remaining oxygen.

**** Silicates
    For the silicates, Si will mostly form compounds with Mg, and to a
    much lesser extent with Ca, Al, Na and Ti (in decreasing
    order). These include MgSiO3 and Mg2SiO4. Let us just assume that
    oxygen is consumed at 3X the rate of silicon.

**** Volatiles
    The remaining volatiles will condense in the form of clathrates
    (gas trapped in water crystals), hydrates and pure
    condensates. This depends on two variables: the temperature of the
    disk and whether the environment is oxidizing or reducing. 

    First, for low temperature, in an oxidizing setting, we have:
    * water
    * carbon monoxide (CO)
    * carbon dioxide (CO2)
    * methanol (CH3OH)
    * methane (CH4)
    * nitrogen (N2)
    * ammonia (NH3)
    * hydrogen sulfide (H2S)
    * phosphine (PH3)

    Assume these ratios:
    * CO/CO2/CH3OH/CH4: 70/10/2/1
    * N2/NH3: 10/1
    * H2S/S: 1/2

    In the reducing environment, carbon is only found in methane, and
    we flip the N2/NH3 ratio.

    Oxidation is only possible for C/O < 4/5. Just below the boundary,
    the oxygen is consumed by oxidation, and there is none left for
    water. Reducing conditions occur for any C/O value, so low C/O
    values will be high in water, and even high C/O values will have
    some water.

    At warmer temperatures, solids are converted to gases. CO and N2
    will be the first to convert as temperature increases. It seems
    reasonable to assume that planets initially form in the cold, and
    then as the disk clears up, the temperature increases and the most
    volatile compounds reenter the gas phase. However, this is
    complicated: 
    http://phys.org/news/2012-07-earth.html
    
*** Atmospheric composition
    A planet will capture a tenuous atmosphere prior to formation
    (mostly H and He), but this is likely to change according to
    complex, geophysical processes that are beyond our ability to
    model. Sorry. For interest in the case of Earth, see:
    http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC31109/

    We can say, however, that a planet must have a sufficient mass to
    retain an atmosphere. This is due to gravity, and the extent of the
    magnetosphere. So far, we have not found any exoplanets that small,
    but we can model the thickness of the atmosphere by the mass. 

    It comes down to plate tectonics, major impact events, and complex
    systems. We will assume outgassing is the major player, because
    other events like comet impacts probably are not generally
    significant. Roughly, the bigger the planet, the more geological
    activity and the more outgassing. Usually, the outgassed material
    will be water vapor, nitrogen or carbon-based. In colder regimes,
    ammonia or hydrogen sulfide are possible. Once released, the
    compounds are oxidized by photoreactions (and other things). This
    means that a carbon-based degassing will eventually end up as CO2,
    H2S as SO2, PH3 as PO3, and NH3 as N2. The temperature does not
    necessarily be high enough to maintain the compounds in the gas
    phase, as long as their is replenishment (from life or
    volcanism). The oxidation of methane would lead to heavy
    hydrocarbons that would form seas.

    Once the gases are established, we can model the temperature by the
    amount of greenhouse gases. The more greenhouse gases, the higher
    the temperature (above the Kepler lower limit) and pressure. That
    will help determine the liquid phase elements on the surface, and
    establish a geochemistry. If we determine that biochemistry is
    possible, this will lead to production of other gases.

*** Types of Geochemistry
    In the below, we assume life is carbon-based. We might go after
    silicon-based life later.

**** Water
     This is like the Earth. Requires liquid water on the
     surface. Water cycle produces water vapor in the atmosphere. And
     life would produce oxygen. For simplicity, we assume a planet has
     a single geochemistry.

**** Carbon
     So-called diamond planets. Requires a very low oxygen content, so
     that metals and silicate form carbides. Any oxygen gets tied up
     into CO. Lots of methane, which could form hydrocarbons that rains
     down to produce tar lakes. Life would breathe CO2 (a major
     component of the atmosphere, with CO), and breathe out O2 (minor
     component). Where does all that oxygen come from? Probably
     deposited by impact events, in the same way that Earth got carbon.

**** Sulfur
     Would have sulfuric acid (H2SO4) instead of water. There would be
     trace sulfuric acid vapor in the atmosphere, and life would
     produce O2. Animals would breathe as on Earth. N2 would be the
     other major component. Why would H2SO4 be favored over water?
     There would need to be a lot more sulfur. Would also tend to be
     hotter (around 88 C).

**** Methane
     Would be very cold, around -179 C, so that methane could serve as
     an alternative to water. Life would produce O2 and N2 from trace
     amounts of NO (oxidized from the dominant N2).

**** Phosphorous
     Based on phosphoric acid (H3PO4) instead of water. Atmosphere will
     contain a lot of PO3. The animals would breathe that and exhale
     PH3 and CO2. Would need to be really hot (171 C). And probably a
     lot of initial PH3.

**** Ammonia
     Very cold (-115 C), so any water is frozen and NH3 replaces
     it. Life would produce N2 and O2 from NH3 and CO2. Animals would
     breathe the O2 and exhale CO2, like on Earth.

**** Iron
     Nothing but an iron core. These are probably
     uninteresting. Exclude them?

*** Putting it all together
    Here is an algorithm:
    * Choose an exoplanet with a known mass, radius, distance from sun,
      gravity, and temperature. We assume its star has a known chemical
      composition.
    * Determine a spin rate for length of day. How?
    * Determine the stone/mineral/ore/metal compositions from observed
      Fe, Ni, and Si = Mg amounts, assuming other metals are like Earth.
    * For the volatile C, N, O, S, P, determine amount of volatiles.
      * First decide redox state: C/O > 0.8, reducing, otherwise 50/50.
      * For oxidizing, oxidate C according to ratios.
      * The rest of O becomes water.
    * Estimate the temperature in the protoplanetary disk to determine
      which volatiles were stable enough to condense. For simplicity,
      we assume the planet temperature is the same as its
      embryonic temperature.
    * Simulate outgassing, establish an atmosphere.
    * Simulate any greenhouse effect, increase temperature accordingly.
    * Establish a geochemistry. To keep things interesting, this should
      also include a biochemistry.
    * Regenerate the atmosphere, based on the chemistry.

*** Simple classification
    Because we need to ensure playability, it is not feasible to simply
    randomly assign all of the parameters indepedently. Instead, we
    should have classes of planets (sort of like biomes, although
    planets should have multiple biomes). Within a class, there is a
    small amount of variability.

    The broadest classification would be something like:
    * Gas giant
    * Ice giant (really a gas giant with supercritical water/methane)
    * Terrestrial (rocky)

    Gas giants would be a tough environment, since it would not be
    possbile to survive on the core, if any. In theory, things could be
    made placeable on gas blocks, while the player would still move
    through them. It would be totally trippy though.

    If we chemically classify terrestrial planets, we have:
    * Silicate planets (like Earth and Minecraft), most common (~96%) in galaxy
    * Carbonate planets (diamonds)
    * Iron planets (one big core)
    * Chlorine (rarest)
    * Ammonia
    * Phosphorous
    * Methane (like Titan)
    * Sulfur
    * Water (like Earth)
    * Ocean

    Since the biogeochemistries other than silicate/water are extremely
    rare, we should probably stick to the familiar, especially given our
    educational motivation. 

    The physical classifications are perhaps more relevant:
    * Lava (protoplanets, close orbiting), making up almost 50% of exoplanets
    * Crater (due to lack of atmosphere)
    * Bare rocks (lifeless)
    * Desert
    * Ice
    * Ocean
    * Forest
    * Civilized

    But who really wants to play on planets that are entirely desert, or
    ocean, or lava, or lifeless? Well, there would still be:
    * Interesting crust composition for mining, with possible
      subterranean life. Depending on the planet radius and silicate
      content, the crust can be quite deep.
    * The technical challenges of constructing, configuring and managing
      the colony structure and the robots.
    * The terraforming challenge.

    The surface could be made more interesting by having supply pods
    scattered all over the planet that were dropped during the crash.
     
* Modules
  It seems like these ideas are too numerous to pack into a single,
  monolithic mod. Instead, we could have separate modules:
  * Geologica: rocks and minerals (ores), generated by MOG,
    biome-based regolith and atmospheric composition.
  * Chemica: Provides chemical recipes and machinery, using the
    materials provided by geologica.
  * Fabrica: High-level crafting as a result of chemistry.

   MineCraft floating around in outer space. Gather iron from
   satellites to build tools and fight aliens.

** Solar System Mod [1.2.5]
   Implements all planets in the solar system,
   semi-realisically. Probably the best one out there, and may
   actually be updated for 1.3.2.

** Night Sky + Space Mod [1.2.5]
   Similar to Solar System Craft. Adds some goofy planets. Revives the
   dead Moon and Mars mods.

** SpaceCraft [1.2.5]
   Revives the Moon mod. Interesting poll on forum: people want
   realistic planets, not unrealistic ones.

** TerraFirmaCraft
   This makes survival mode more realistic and challenging. It adds a
   huge number of ores, stones, minerals, metals, gems, and
   trees. These can be very useful for teaching geology and (on some
   planets) biology. We would like to present a similar challenge
   level; however, it is unclear whether such a low level of
   technology (starting with bare hands) would be both interesting and
   an effective means of education. Right now, we are just learning
   from its code, especially with regard to the world
   generation. Handling multiple rock types is a pain.

** Underground Biomes
   This is probably the most similar to geologica: adds 8 types of
   igneous, metamorphic and sedimentary rock, with ores spawning only
   in certain rock types. New types of cobblestone, half slabs,
   etc. Sort of has a different goal though. It wants to make the
   underground more interesting, including underground villages, etc,
   while we just want to add more substances to the game.

** Gasses in Minecraft
   Adds gas sources, transport and processing. About 5-10 gasses are
   supported; apparently there is an API for adding
   more. Unfortunately, does not seem to integrate with BC.
   
** GasCraft
   Not as mature as "Gasses in Minecraft" but integrates with BC.
   
* Mod Integration
** BuildCraft
   * Machines should interface with BC pipes and energy
   * Will probably add a new type of pipe: insulated, tracks temp.
   
** IndustrialCraft
   Will add recipes for all of its machines, and electrolysis will
   use its electricity.

** Thermal Expansion
   This provides a number of buildcraft-powered machines, many of

** Thaumcraft
   We should add magical aspects to every item.
   
** Custom Ore Generation
   Enables full customization of ore deposit generation, including
   the pattern, size, depth, biome, etc of the deposits. By default,
   ore deposits form long, twisting veins that lead to a
   "motherlode". This is more fun/playable than e.g. the TFC
   generation. But one interesting idea from TFC is that certain ores
   only generate in certain types of rock. This generator should
   support that constraint, but first one needs multiple rock types.  

** ExtraBiomesXL
   Will generate rocks/ores in all of its biomes. Hopefully this
   integrates with Forgotten Nature, which would add many trees and
   crops.

     (WOW)

     May be a bit too much and overlaps a lot with other mods.
   
** MineChem
   Sort of a scientific mix of EE3 Thaumcraft. Substances are broken
   down into chemicals (as revealed by a microscope), and those
   chemicals can be broken down into their elements. By recombining
   elements and then combining those compounds, substances are
   (re)created. Even has BuildCraft and ComputerCraft turtle
   integration. Models are cool, and the overall concept is as well,
   but the equivalent exchange mechanic bothers me. Its a lot cooler
   though than EE itself.

   Presumably we could define our chemicals within this
   system. Probably better to do our own thing for now.

** Chemicals
   Clearly, we need an object that represents a chemical. Should this
   be the GeoSubstance? A GeoSubstance is essentially an object that
   represents a block/item*meta/damage combination. Each GeoBlock is
   formed from a material*strength combination, which corresponds to a
   particular hardness and resistance, as well as a item drop
   strategy. We use inheritance to define both of those aspects. With
   regard to the item dropping, this is in-line with the rest of
   Minecraft, although we could use association, instead. There are no
   obvious benefits though. The strength mapping depends on
   intact/broken, and that also influences the item drops. It could be
   defined by some factory, but that introduces yet another
   component. The nice thing is that we have avoided using special
   subclasses for each set of sub/metablocks; that is now
   parameterized by dynamic lookup of substances given a material and
   strength. It is only necessary to declare a substance, and most
   things work as expected.

   For defining substances, we have used a material parameter, instead
   of inheritance, for defining the type of substance. This may have
   been a mistake, since inheritance is natural in some cases, like
   how a mineral is also a chemical. If we changed to inheritance, the
   GeoBlock would be passed a GeoSubstance subclass, instead of a
   Material object. We are sort of subverting the Material objects
   currently, so that might be a worthy change.

   The problem: whether a substance is a chemical is an orthogonal
   concept to the material type. Some rocks can be chemicals. Really
   the only differences between a mineral and some other chemical are
   (a) it is a solid and (b) it is naturally occurring. The phase of
   the chemical at standard temperature is obviously a parameter of
   the chemical that would be defined by association. So maybe
   whether a substance is naturally occurring should be a parameter?
   Even substances of the "rock" material cannot be assumed to be
   natural; for example, concrete and bricks are very rock-like,
   despite being synthetic.

   Or we say that a GeoSubstance is always something naturally
   occuring. There are rocks and minerals. The minerals have a
   reference to a chemical. The chemicals would be stored in a
   separate database. Hopefully this will not present any
   complications. 
   
** Block Construction
   When creating a GeoBlock from a material, we need to decide who
   implements the construction. Currently, this is a mix between a
   static factory method in GeologicaBlocks, and the subclass
   constructors. Somehow, we should either put most everything inside
   the constructors or put everything in some sort of factory.

   Here are the steps:
   * (factory) ID allocation/assignment, name
   * (constructor) material, creative tab, step sound 
   * (constructor) meta blocks
   * (constructor) hardness and resistance

   Is this a natural split? The ID allocation should happen
   up-front. The name then obviously needs to be set by the factory
   (probably via setter). The material is tied to the subclass
   (inheritance is used only to define the items dropped). If we know
   the material, then we know the step sound. The creative tab is
   always known to be a block.

   The hardness/resistance are tied to the strength, and the meta
   blocks are tied to the material and strength.  By putting the meta
   blocks, hardness/resistance and material into the same, low-level
   constructor, we ensure that all the values are consistent in terms
   of the strength. But we could make the block completely agnostic of
   strength: it would just take the given meta blocks and
   hardness/resistance, etc. If we then passed the texture file as a
   parameter, we could get rid of the intact/broken subclasses. But
   making the blocks agnostic of strength would be tricky, since they
   are given GeoSubstance objects, which have a strength. Is there a
   reason to demand such flexibility? Do we really need multiple
   strategies for finding meta blocks given a strength?

** GeoSubstance as an Enum
   The GeoSubstance would be convenient as an enum, as long as we do
   not expect substances to come from some other source. The
   convenience comes from both the syntax and automatic registration
   (via reflection). Other mods could add substances, for example. If
   that happened, there would need to be a configuration system to
   prevent ID conflicts. Why would they want to add new substances?
   Probably to take advantage of the chemical modeling. Since IDs are
   only necessary for meta/damage values, we could introduce an
   independent object, maybe Chemical, that would simply define a
   set of chemical properties. It is not yet clear whether we will
   have a sophisticated chemical model or if we will just add recipes
   for particular chemicals. If the latter, there may be no benefit
   to adding new substances. They would just be an internal utility
   for book-keeping of the meta blocks and items. Since those
   substances do not have any behaviors, it probably will not be
   necessary to extend them. They are simple tuples of data.

** Substances and blocks, etc
   We want to represent substances in the world. For now, let us
   limit the discussion to geological substances: rocks and
   minerals. A substance can assume many forms. In the world, it is
   as an intact block. If the block is broken, it yields a broken
   form. The granularity of the broken form depends on the intact
   strength. So weak stone becomes gravel, strong stone becomes
   cobblestone and very strong stone remains intact. 

   An intact block for a substance is more or less defined by the
   following properties:
   * Material/stepSound (from material)
   * Hardness/resistance (from strength)
   * Drop strategy (subclass)
   
   Currently, we use the substance material to do two things: derive
   the material of the block and select substances for a particular
   drop strategy (block subclass). This is a problem, because both
   rocks and minerals can be of the "rock" material, but minerals have
   a different drop strategy. And direct-drop substances could be
   rocks, sands, or maybe even dirt or clay. This substance/material
   type could be a parameter of the substance, or we could imply it by
   keeping the substances in separate lists. Separate lists would
   probably mean separate enums, all of which implement some
   GeoSubstance interface. The separate enums could each have unique
   qualities. For example, a mineral could reference a chemical. If we
   did not go the separate list/enum route, every substance would have
   a chemical field, with non-minerals using a null value. The pain of
   separate enums is that we would need to reimplement substance for
   each type. The implementation is not complicated, but it is extra
   effort. Anyway, it is clear that the material and harvest strategy
   are two different parameters.

   So if wanted to parameterize the drop/harvest strategy, what are
   the possibilities?
   * a single, broken block (stone)
   * multiple pieces (coal, redstone, clay)
   * self drop (ores, sandstone)
   
   Claystone could follow the sandstone example, which essentially
   exists in a broken/cobble state. Then a machine like a pulverizer
   could convert claystone to clay (as it does sandstone to sand). So
   at this point, we will support the single-broken (stone) and
   self-drop strategies (minerals).

   There are then three parameters:
   * Strength: weak, medium, strong, very strong
   * Harvest: self (default), broken, pieces
   * Material: rock (default), sand
     
   The next debate is whether to add parameters for e.g. the chemical
   which would be yielded upon pulverizing or smelting a mineral. One
   issue is that it might become untenable to specify recipes through
   substance properties. There are so many machines, with so many
   recipes. Might be simplest to consider the recipes orthogonal. One
   might try to make the case that we need chemicals in order to add
   the chemical formula to e.g. a tooltip, or something. But this is
   not so important.

   We could translate the harvest style to a "type" of substance:
   * Rock: broken (cobblestone)
   * Ore: self
   * Crystal: pieces
   This makes a lot of sense. Rocks and ores should be a single
   block; no reason to have individual pieces. And ore does not
   matter whether it is broken or intact. Crystals though are easily
   obtained during mining. There is some question as to whether these
   represent all types of geological substances. If we wanted to
   support an arbitrary set, we would probably want to use
   polymorphism instead of a parameter.
   
** Textures
   If we use the substance IDs as indexes into the sprite maps, we
   will need a separate map for every manifestation of the
   substance. There will be several manifestations: intact (rocks and
   minerals in native form, metal ingots), broken (cobblestone,
   pulverized minerals, metal nuggets), and processed (bricks for
   stone, blocks of metal). As long as we are limited to these three,
   it makes sense to use a separate file for each. May need a fourth
   for arbitrary textures.
